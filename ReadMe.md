< Project Name > 
 Brown Bag
​
< App > 
 Brown Bag allows restaurants to process orders without the need of a large waitstaff, along with cutting out the fees associated with current popular food apps. Instead of charging a large percentage of each transaction, Brown Bag will only charge a small, monthly fee while providing the same level of service.
​
< User Persona >
Name: Hunter
Age: 35
Bio: A father who is working from home with two kids. Isn’t a huge fan of cooking and wants to support local businesses.
​
< User Story >
Hunter is struggling with ordering food amid COVID restrictions. Due to the high percentages most restaurant delivery apps take, the cost to order a simple meal to feed themselves or their family can quickly get expensive. Between the delivery fees, the charges added by the platform he uses, sales tax, and a tip, the small lunch that should cost around $12 ends up becoming $30. The food itself, being sold from restaurants that don’t typically deliver, arrives soggy, room temperature, and not at all like he wants. Brown Bag will allow Hunter to order from an app and eat either inside or outside of the restaurant without needing to interface directly with a waiter or waitress to limit the chance of transmission.
